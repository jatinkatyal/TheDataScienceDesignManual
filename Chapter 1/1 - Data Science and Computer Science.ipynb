    "Data Science is a combined understanding of Computer Science, Statistics and Application Domain. From Computer Science we take algorithms and techniques such as Machine Learning along with high performance computing technologies. Statistics is needed for data exploration, hypothesis testing and visualization. Application Domain provides the problem for which we apply these techniques and also the evaluation criterias for assesment.\n",

    "It is widely popular now because of the vast ammount of data with companies and technology to analyzye it. Most important reason is because Facebook and Google are doing it (:P). Also, we saw Moneyball where Brad Pitt used data to win the championship (LOL!) Also it is my personnel desire to create a system which can generate a dream team for cricket fantasy league, and i dont know much about cricket (Tough to believe if you know I am an Indian). I am stepping in this without any set goals but, it will be great if after this book we can build this out."

    "![A Sugarcane juice vendor in India](sugarcane2.jpg)With computer science or software engineering perspective, we always try to get an algorithm through which we can parse the data. Traditional approaches treats algorithm like a juicer, you push in the pulp and final result comes out of it. In computer science we create our set of variables and flags in our simple virtual world where as real world is complex and data scientists try to understand it. Where computer science is about inventing an algorithm, data science is about discovering what is already available in data."

This data is analysed in real time by the ground staff for any maintainence required for optimum efficency of flight.</li>\n",
