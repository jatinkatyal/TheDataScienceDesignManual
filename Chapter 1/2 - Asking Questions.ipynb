    "Earlier i discusssed the difference between computer science and data science. In that it was stressed that data scientists try to discover, understand meaning of why and how something happen. This is done by asking questions, once you have the data you should asking questions and find answers to it using what you obtained. To ask questions, you should be familliar with the field. This can be done be creating a social connection with people who work in that sector, you can also connect with peers working in same domain. One should try to get most from these people. Widening the range of interests will definitely help."
